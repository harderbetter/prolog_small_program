Here is the small program I design use prolog language. The knowledge base and the output has listed above.Here are the tasks that I accomplished:

1.	Translate System Requirements, Domain Properties, and Assumptions toa Prolog Database to be used for consistency checking from the given logical non-Prolog statements.

2.	Set the appropriate software state to be true and verify that the resulting system state is a requirement statement that is true.

3.	Set the appropriate system state to be true and verifying that the resulting software state is a requirement statement that is true.

More about prolog:
Prolog is a general-purpose logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is declarative: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.

The language was first conceived by a group around Alain Colmerauer in Marseille, France, in the early 1970s and the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel.

Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages, and remains the most popular among such languages today, with several free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for theorem proving, expert systems, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing.  Modern Prolog environments support creating graphical user interfaces, as well as administrative and networked applications.

Prolog is well-suited for specific tasks that benefit from rule-based logical queries such as searching databases, voice control systems, and filling templates.
